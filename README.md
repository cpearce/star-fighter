# Star Fighter

Remake of a simple game I made while in high school using Rust and SDL2.

The artwork was designed by my six year old. :)

To build & run, [install Rust via Rustup](https://rustup.rs/), and [download and install SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/). You also need to follow the [Rust SDL2 crate's installation instructions](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2) to ensure you install the SDL2 link libraries where Rust's linker can find them.

Then run with `$cargo run`.
